Analyzes terrain for navigational decision-making:

- Terrain classification using visual data
- Slope and traversability assessment
- Obstacle detection and mapping
- Jump point identification

### `flight_path_manager.py`

Manages in-game flight paths for efficient travel:

- Flight node discovery and tracking
- Flight connection management
- Multi-hop route optimization
- Travel time and cost estimation

### `dungeon_navigator.py`

Specialized navigation for dungeon environments:

- Dungeon map representation and processing

- Boss and treasure location tracking
- Tactical movement in combat situations

## Navigation Data Structures

### Position3D

Represents a point in 3D space with utility methods:
```python
position = Position3D(x=100.5, y=200.3, z=10.0)
distance = position.distance_to(other_position)
```

### TerrainTypes

Classifications for different terrain with movement costs:
```python
TerrainType.NORMAL      # Regular terrain (cost: 1.0)
TerrainType.GRASS       # Slightly slower (cost: 1.2)
TerrainType.WATER_SHALLOW # Wadeable water (cost: 2.0)
TerrainType.WATER_DEEP  # Swimming (cost: 5.0)
TerrainType.MOUNTAIN    # Steep terrain (cost: 3.0)
TerrainType.CLIFF       # Very difficult (cost: 10.0)
TerrainType.UNWALKABLE  # Blocked terrain (cost: infinite)
```

### TerrainMap

3D grid of navigable terrain:
```python
terrain_map = TerrainMap("elwynn_forest")
node = terrain_map.get_node_at(position)
neighbors = terrain_map.get_neighbors(node)
```

### FlightNode and FlightConnection

Network of flight paths:
```python
stormwind = FlightNode("Stormwind", position, "elwynn_forest")
ironforge = FlightNode("Ironforge", position, "dun_morogh")
connection = FlightConnection(stormwind, ironforge, 3.5)  # 3.5 min flight
```

### DungeonMap and DungeonArea

Specialized representation of dungeons:
```python
deadmines = DungeonMap("The Deadmines", "dungeon")
entrance = DungeonArea("Entrance", level=0)
boss_room = DungeonArea("Rhahk'Zor's room", level=0)
deadmines.add_area(entrance)
deadmines.add_area(boss_room)
entrance.add_connection("Rhahk'Zor's room", position)
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic 3D Navigation

```python
# Initialize the navigation system
nav_manager = AdvancedNavigationManager(config, knowledge, basic_nav)

# Navigate to a 3D position
current_pos = Position3D(player_x, player_y, player_z)
target_pos = Position3D(target_x, target_y, target_z)
actions = nav_manager.navigate_to(game_state, target_pos.to_tuple(), "elwynn_forest")

# Execute navigation actions
for action in actions:
    if action["type"] == "move":
        move_to_position(action["position"])
    elif action["type"] == "jump":
        perform_jump()
    # ...
```

### Flight Path Travel

```python
# Initialize flight path manager
flight_manager = FlightPathManager(config, knowledge)

# Find optimal flight path
start_pos = Position3D(player_x, player_y, player_z)
end_pos = Position3D(target_x, target_y, target_z)
flight_actions = flight_manager.find_flight_path(
    "elwynn_forest", start_pos, 
    "dun_morogh", end_pos
)

# Execute flight actions
for action in flight_actions:
    if action["type"] == "move":
        move_to_position(action["position"])
    elif action["type"] == "use_flight_path":
        use_flight_master(action["source"], action["destination"])
    # ...
```

### Dungeon Navigation

```python
# Initialize dungeon navigator
dungeon_nav = DungeonNavigator(config, knowledge)

# Check if in dungeon
if dungeon_nav.is_in_dungeon(game_state):
    # Get current dungeon
    current_dungeon = dungeon_nav.detect_current_dungeon(game_state)
    
    # Navigate to next boss
    next_boss = dungeon_nav.get_next_boss(game_state)
    if next_boss:
        actions = dungeon_nav.navigate_to_boss(game_state, next_boss["name"])
        
        # Execute navigation actions
        for action in actions:
            execute_action(action)
```

## Integrating with Game Knowledge

The navigation system integrates with the game knowledge base for:

- Zone data and connections
- Known flight paths
- Dungeon maps and boss locations
- Terrain data and obstacles

This allows the system to learn and improve navigation over time as it discovers new areas and paths.

## Performance Considerations

- Pathfinding algorithms are selected based on terrain complexity and distance
- Path caching improves performance for frequently traveled routes
- Multi-threading is used for complex pathfinding operations
- Dynamic obstacle detection runs at a lower frequency to conserve resources

## Future Enhancements

- Machine learning for terrain traversal optimization
- Player behavior modeling for more human-like movement
- Crowd-sourced path optimization from multiple agent experiences
- Visual landmark-based navigation for areas without map data
